                1. About these terms and conditions
            </h3>
            <p>
                1.1. When used below, the abbreviation TSExU herein stands for The Salamander Explorer Unit. In all
                circumstances, this acronym should be understood as The Salamander Explorer Unit working with Poole
                District Scouts (PDS), Dorset County Scouts (DCS), The Scout Assossiation (TSA), and the World Scout
                Bureau (WSB) including the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). All organisations recognised
                by the acronym have authoritive control over this website and its content and reserve the right to
                interpret and regulate these terms and conditions in their own way.
            </p>
            <p>
                1.2. Access to and use of this website both within the UK and internationally is provided by TSExU.
                These terms apply to your use of the website and shall take effect immediately from your first use of
                the website and thereafter. Please note, in order to use the website you must agree to be bound by all
                the terms provided (Please note, if you do not agree to be bound all the terms herein, TSExU does not
                permit you to access, use and/or contribute to the website).
            </p>
            <p>
                1.3. TSExU may change these terms from time to time and so you should check these on a regular basis.
                Your continued use of the website will be deemed acceptance of any updated or amended terms. If you do
                not agree to the changes, you should cease using the website. If there is any conflict between these
                terms and specific local terms appearing elsewhere on the website then the latter shall prevail in
                relation to the matter to which it specifically relates.

                (c) MUST NOT violate, plagiarise, or infringe the rights of TSExU or third parties including copyright,
                trade mark, trade secrets, privacy, publicity, personal or proprietary rights;

                informs you why your contribution has been refused or edited. This email will also include a warning
                that continuing to break the rules may result in action being taken against you. This action may include
                any content posted by you being checked before being allowed to go on the site or a temporary or
                permanent suspension of your ability to participate in any or all of the website community areas.
                <br>

                anywhere else on the website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on the website, and TSExU

                available to it about you to stop any further such infringements. This may include informing relevant
                third parties such as your employer, Scouting line-manager, school or email provider about the
                infringement(s).
                <br>
                (c) TSExU reserves the right to delete any contribution at any time, for any reason.

                4. Your contributions to TSExU and/or the website
            </h3>
            <p>
                4.1. By sharing any contribution (including any text, photographs, graphics, video or audio) with TSExU
                you agree to grant to the TSExU, free of charge, permission to use the material in any way it wants
                (including modifying and adapting it for operational and editorial reasons) for TSExU&apos;s services in
                any media worldwide (including on TSExU&apos;s site accessed by international users). In certain
                circumstance TSExU may also share your contribution with trusted third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.2. Copyright in your contribution will remain with you and this permission is not exclusive, so you

            <p>
                4.3. In order that TSExU can use your contribution, you confirm that your contribution is your own
                original work, is not defamatory and does not infringe any UK laws, that you have the right to give
                TSExU permission to use it for the purposes specified above, and that you have the consent of anyone who

            <p>
                4.4. TSExU normally shows your name with your contribution, unless you request otherwise, but for
                operational reasons this is not always possible. TSExU may need to contact you for administrative or
                verification purposes in relation to your contribution, or in relation to particular projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.5. Please do not endanger yourself or others, take any unnecessary risks or break any laws when

                5. The Website Communities
            </h3>
            <p>
                5.1. In order to participate in and contribute to selected website communities you may be required to
                register with the website. Any personal information supplied to the website as part of this registration
                process and/or any other interaction with the website will be collected, stored and used in accordance
                with TSExU&apos;s website privacy statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                5.2. The Use of Personal Data: As protecting privacy is very important to the Association, anyone using
                the Unit&apos;s website or database facilities must also ensure that the privacy of others is protected
                throughout. Therefore, any personal information (Personal Data) about another accessed, downloaded or
                obtained via the Unit&apos;s websites/databases must be handled in compliance with the Data Protection
                Act. For more information about the rules please see <a href="https://www.ico.org.uk/">ico.org.uk</a>.
                In summary, Personal Data is any information by which a person can be identified e.g. name, address
                (including email address), telephone number or particular role within scouting etc and when handling
                such data:
                <br>
                (a) YOU MUST only obtain and use it for the legitimate scouting purpose as required and authorised by
                your role;
                <br>
                (b) YOU MUST only retain it for the legitimate scouting purpose as required and authorised by your role
                and, where retention is justified, must ensure that it is kept accurate, up-to-date and in a secure
                manner so as to prevent accidental loss, theft or unauthorised access by others;
                <br>
                (c) YOU MUST only retain it for as long as legitimately required and thereafter delete or destroy it
                safely and securely;
                <br>
                (d) YOU MUST NOT share it with any other party unless you have the person&apos;s express consent to do
                so - preferably in writing wherever possible. This applies to sharing such data with any external party
                as well as within scouting itself e.g. emails sent to more than one recipient should, as a rule, be
                &apos;blind copied&apos; (Bcc) so that the recipients do not receive details of each other&apos;s email
                addresses.
                <br>
                (e) YOU MUST NOT, in any event, send it outside of the European Economic Association (EEA) unless you
                are sure that the country you are sending it operates under Data Protection laws akin to the UK and you
                have received assurance from them that the data will remain protected by them.

            <p>

                warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, compatibility,
                security and accuracy. TSExU does not guarantee the timeliness, completeness or performance of the
                website or any of the content. While we try to ensure that all content provided by TSExU is correct at

                or inaccurate content on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                6.3. You agree to indemnify TSExU and/or TSExU&apos;s officers, directors, employees and volunteers,
                immediately on demand, against all claims, liability, damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees,

            <p>
                7.1. If any of these Terms and Conditions are determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise
                unenforceable by reason of the laws of any state or country in which these terms are intended to be
                effective, then to the extent and within the jurisdiction in which that term is illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from these terms and the remaining terms shall survive
                and continue to be binding and enforceable.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.2. The failure or delay of TSExU to exercise or enforce any right in these terms does not waive
                TSExU&apos;s right to enforce that right.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.3. These terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales
